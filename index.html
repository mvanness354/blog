  	Hello everybody! Welcome to my website!
  	</p>

  	<p>
	I'm Mike Van Ness, PhD student in Management Science and Engineering at Stanford University.
	I recently moved with my advisor, Madeleine Udell, from Cornell University, where I was a PhD student in Statistics. 
	I mostly research problems related to missing values in tabular data, with application in healthcare.
	I also am interested in tabular deep learning and time series forecasting.
	I take pride in having a diverse data science skillset, including statistical fundamentals, traditional machine learning, and deep learning.

  	In my free time, I like spending time outdoors when possible.  
	I love all of the seasons!  I enjoy hiking, running, golfing, ultimate frisbee-ing, and skiing.  
	I'm also passionate about jazz music, playing saxophone, piano, and more recently, guitar.  
	Lastly, I'm a huge sports fan: go Celtics, Yankees, Patriots, and Man City!
