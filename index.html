  	Hello everybody! Welcome to my website!
  	</p>

  	<p>
	I'm Mike Van Ness, PhD student in Management Science and Engineering at Stanford University.
	I'm fortunate to be advised by [Madeleine Udell](https://web.stanford.edu/~udell/), who also advised me as a Statistics PhD student at Cornell before 
	our move to Stanford. 
	I mostly research problems related to missing values in tabular data, with applications in healthcare.
	I also am interested in tabular deep learning and interpretable machine learning.
	Besides my research, I am passionate about teaching and mentoring.
	This summer, I am excited to be interning at Uber, where I will be working on the AI Platform team.

  	In my free time, I like spending time outdoors when possible.  
	I love all of the seasons!  I enjoy hiking, running, golfing, ultimate frisbee-ing, and skiing.  
	I'm also love making music, playing saxophone, piano, and more recently, guitar.  
	Lastly, I'm a huge sports fan: go Celtics, Yankees, Patriots, and Man City!
