  	Hello everybody! Welcome to my website and blog!
  	</p>

  	<p>
  	I'm Mike Van Ness, PhD student in the statistics department at Cornell University working with Madeleine Udell.  My academic interest broadly lies in machine learning and model building.  I believe in having a strong and diverse understanding of how to model any kind of data, ranging from simple linear regression to state-of-the-art deep learning.  I'm currently researching multimodal machine learning, focusing on the fusion of tabular data with other data sources such as text and images.

  	In my free time, I like spending time outdoors when possible.  I love all of the seasons!  I enjoy hiking, running, golfing, ultimate frisbee-ing, and skiing.  I'm also passionate about jazz music, playing saxophone and piano.  Lastly, I'm a huge sports fan: go Celtics, Yankees, Patriots, and Man City!
